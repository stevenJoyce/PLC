<p> Massive acceleration- the forbidden fruit! It's easy to
    avoid such unlawful <img src="viper-1.png" width= "150"
	height= "128" alt= "Viper Front"> activities in a normal
	vehicle. But there is an evil serpent; a viper that tempts
	you to take a bite out of the asphalt. With a tasty 500-hp 
	V10 powering a mere 3,300-lb roadster, the Dodge Viper 
	SRT-10 tricks you into playing music with the loud pedal.</p>

<p>This car is too excessive , too epic for most people to use on 
   a daily basis. <img src="viper-2.png" width= "155" height= "115"
   alt="Viper Rear"> But for otherwise nice couples who need only
   two seats this is the car that will shame those who come up
   against them. </p>
   
<p class="clear">If you can afford to... Buy one. You'll like it </p
