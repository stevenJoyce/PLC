<P>Unlike in word processing, putting in lots of spaces or blank lines has no
effect in HTML.</P>


<br>
<br>
<br>

<P>Any amount of "white space" (spaces, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	tabs, carriage





returns) are                                                              treated
as a 
single space.</P></BODY></HTML>
