<h1> Evolution of HTML from HTML 2.0 to HTML 5 </h1>
<p>
Introduction to HTML 
<p>
<p>
There has been many different versions of HTML with most new versions an improvement
on the previous version. HTML began as an idea of Tim Berners-Lee, he first began working 
on this in 1980 and spent the next 9 years completing it until he finished it in 1989
while working for CERN.
Most important HTML Versions
<ul>
HTML 2.0
HTML 3.0
HTML 4.01
HTML 5.0
</ul>
</p>
<p>
HTML 2.0
<p>
<p>
The introduction of HTML 2 was the first version of classic HTML. It was introduced on 24th November 1995. 
This specification supported more browsers. HTML 2.0 was considerably improved to support;
It also supported forms with limited set of form elements such as text boxes, and option buttons, 
change of page background and the use of tables but were poorly aligned. Around this time, 
HTML 1.1 also existed and was created by Netscape. Between HTML 1.0 and HTML 2.0 W3C was formed. 
It was the standard for HTML until January 1997.
</p>

<p>
HTML 3.2
<p>
<p>
During the time November 1994 – January 1997 the world of web oriented design was full of tags that were browser specific.
This was detrimental to all the efforts the World Wide Web Consortium had done to format and set the standard to the coding of web browsers. 
They did not like that people were using different tags for different browsers that are essentially the same thing. 
They decided to introduce good alignment of tables, images, headers and more. It also worked with all browsers and became the standard HTML version. 
It is still able to work perfectly today because practically all browsers still support it.
</p>

<p>
HTML 4.01
<p>
<p>
In December 1997, the World Wide Web Consortium introduced the version 4.0 of HTML, this became the standard in April 1998 
but this was flawed and in December 1999 the HTML version 4.01 was introduced. This had several changes to the layout of tables-
It introduced the use of (“. “) the alignment of decimal points to numbers and (“:”).  
It also made the rules more flexible to what you are coding into tables. It is still supported by browsers today.
</p>

<p>
HTML 5
<p>
<p>
It was released on 28th October 2014. One of the biggest new features is that the new version has a new doctype and uses UTF-8. 
It also has new tags to define different sections of the page such as "section", "header" and"footer".
 The use of HTML 5 has simplified a lot of thing sand has been viewed as a major step forward for web designing.
