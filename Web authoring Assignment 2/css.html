<h1> Evolution of CSS </h1>
<p>
<p>
Introduction to CSS
<p>
The creation of HTML and the World Wide Web Consortium led to the creation of CSS.
CSS has had many different versions over the years but the most important ones are;
<ul>
CSS 1
CSS 2
CSS 2.1
CSS 3
</ul>
<p>

<p>
CSS 1
<P>
<P>
The first version of CSS was created on 17th November 1996. 
It was created to return the roots of the internet and get rid of all the content from the browser. 
The style sheet was created to separate the design from the default coding. It increased the speed of browsers, made the web page coding easier to read. 
The author can easily access the mistakes they may make in the styling of the webpage with it separate from the information. 
<p>

<p>
CSS 2
<p>
<p>
This evolved the CSS 1 into a multi-functional page with the style sheet now able to make the web page be seen in braille, 
work with and format printers to your style. It also tailored webpages for handheld devices 
such as phones and aural device for the hearing impaired.
<p>

<p>
CSS 2.1
<p>
<p>
This version of CSS was created in June 2001. It was created because of errors reported in CSS 2 
and the World Wide Web Consortium wanted to implement a small amount of change to the way we code by taking out things that will be obsolete with CSS 3.0. 
<p>

<p>
CSS 3
<p>
<p>
CSS 3 was released in 2011 and 2012. It added over 50 new modules such as Color, Media Queries, Grid Layout and transitions. 
It also added several new selectors, values and properties to the CSS database.
